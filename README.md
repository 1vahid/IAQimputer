## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **`config.py`**  
  Global configuration: data paths, model output directories, common training parameters, and rename mappings for plots.

- **`data_utils.py`**  
  Utility functions to:  
  - Load and preprocess IAQ datasets  
  - Generate sliding windows  
  - Reconstruct the full time series from windowed outputs  
  - Post-process model predictions  
  - Produce visualization assets (e.g., heatmaps)

- **`models.py`**  
  Load or train deep‚Äêimputation architectures (US-GAN, Transformer, CSDI, BRITS) and the forecasting transformer.

- **`evaluation.py`**  
  Evaluation routines for:  
  - Traditional imputation baselines  
  - Deep-learning imputation methods under various missingness scenarios  
  - Forecasting accuracy metrics  
  - Missing-data simulation  
  - Automated hyperparameter tuning

- **`main.py`**  
  Pipeline orchestration:  
  1. Ingest and preprocess data  
  2. Train or load models  
  3. Simulate missing-data scenarios  
  4. Evaluate imputation and forecasting  
  5. Export CSV summaries and visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts)
